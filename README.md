# Emotion-Recognition-
For full-face emotion recognition, techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), and their fusion are employed. In contrast, for region-based emotion recognition, individual facial features such as the eyes, eyebrows, nose, and mouth feature extrcation approaches are proposed to detect emotions.
